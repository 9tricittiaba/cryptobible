RSA is both a signature and an asymmetric encryption scheme. It is important to know which algorithm and which version of it you are using (as not all of them are secure); they are mostly defined in PKCS#1 documents (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2313">v1.5</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2437">v2.0</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447">v2.1</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017#section-7.2">v2.2</a>).

== Is RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 secure? ==

'''No'''. <a href="http://archiv.infsec.ethz.ch/education/fs08/secsem/bleichenbacher98.pdf">Bleichenbacher found an attack on PKCS#1 v1.5 in 1998</a> which allows to decrypt the content of any encrypted payload, as long as the server advertises (or leaks) the validity of a ciphertext's PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. In spite of this, most certificates on the internet (and thus most internet protocols) are stil using this old and broken primitive. This has led to difficult work arounds and mitigations that have been found not to work over and over:

== What keysize should be used? ==

As with every keysize concerns, www.keylength.com is often the answer.

In addition, the <a href="https://wordpress.rose-hulman.edu/holden/the-mathematics-of-secrets/cryptography-by-the-numbers/">cryptography by the numbers</a> page gives some idea of what academic attacks have been able to do.
