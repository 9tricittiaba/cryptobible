The most populars being TLS, SSH and IPSEC.\nEach usually being used for different purposes. Yet, many developers\nwill often feel the need to re-invent the wheel and create their own\n\"proprietary\" protocol. You've heard the saying \"don't roll your own\ncrypto\", so you know you should use TLS. If you're not using TLS because\nyou have an excellent reason not to use TLS, you are allowed to consider\nthe Noise protocol framework,\nbut keep in mind that even Noise requires you to understand what you're\ndoing.\nTLS\nWhile TLS is usually used between browsers and webservers, there are no\nlimitations as to how one can use TLS and to what kind of endpoints are\nable to use TLS to protect their communications. Because of this initial\nsetting though, TLS is commonly encountered as a protocol that\nauthenticates the server only and does not care about the client\n(perhaps the client authenticates later via a password in the\napplication layer). Yet, this does not mean that TLS is limited to this\nconfiguration and client authentication (via certificates) as part of\nthe protocol is totally possible.\nNote that TLS is sometimes seen deeply integrated with another kind of\nprotocol. For example the QUIC protocol (sometimes refered to as TCP\n2.0) has encryption by default thanks to TLS.\nWhat Versions of SSL/TLS Are Secure?\nThe design of SSL/TLS has had many broken versions in the past. For this\nreason, practically nobody uses SSL anymore and more secure versions of\nTLS (1.2 and 1.3) are pushed for adoption.\n\n\n\nVersion\nSecure\nVulnerabilities\n\n\n\n\nSSL 3\nno\nPOODLE, RC4NOMORE\n\n\nTLS 1.0\nno\nBEAST, RC4NOMORE\n\n\nTLS 1.1\nyes\n/\n\n\nTLS 1.2\nyes\n/\n\n\nTLS 1.3\nyes\n/\n\n\n\nIdeally, only TLS 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 should be supported. Hyper\nideally, only the last version (TLS 1.3) should be supported.\nCan TLS 1.0 And 1.1 Still Be Supported?\nUnfortunately, many clients continue to use older versions and it is\nsometimes tricky to continue to support them. This leads to the\nquestion, can we support older version securely?\nNote that if you need to follow strong regulations like the\nPCI DSS,\nAnything under TLS 1.1 has been deprecated which should facilitate this\nanswer.\nNon-web browser  web server setup. Both\nPOODLE\n(SSL 3.0) and\nBEAST (TLS 1.0) are attacks that usually imply a browser-based client.\nThis is because the attack has several requirements:\n\nthe attacker needs a way to execute malicious code on the client-side in order to emite specific SSL/TLS packets (this is usually done by serving malicious javascript to the client)\neach client's encrypted packet content is in part known (usually true for browsers since we know what HTTP requests look like)\nwhat we want to steal is repeatedly and automatically sent in every requests emitted by the client (we are usually targeting a cookie)\n\nFor this reason, most of the non-browser-webserver scenarios might\nnot be vulnerable to these attacks. Nonetheless attacks only get\nbetter and one should not rely on a specific scenario to mitigate a\npowerful attack.\nWeb browser  web server setup. While SSL 3.0 is pretty\nmuch broken and can even endanger secure versions of TLS\n(DROWN), we know ways to\nmitigate the BEAST attack on TLS 1.0. These mitigations are implemented in\nall modern browsers which let us conclude that\nBEAST is no longer a threat. With that in mind, supporting TLS 1.0 is\npossible, but not recommended.\nCan SSL 3.0 Still Be Supported?\nWhile\nsome companies still support SSL 3.0, it is a difficult endeavor as the\nprotocol is completely broken by the POODLE attack and the numerous\nattacks on RC4. You should not support it unless you have extremely good reasons and you know what\nyou're doing.\nIs It Possible To Support Several Versions of TLS?\nThe first problem in supporting several versions of TLS is in the\ncertificates presented by the server (and possibly the client). If they\nare the same accross different versions of TLS, we are doing what is\neffectively called \"key re-use\". The next question \"Can I re-use a\nserver's private key?\" approaches the problems with that.\nIn addition, clients will often \"fallback\" to older versions if they\ncannot connect to more recent versions. This is all done in good faith\nbut can in some cases be induced by malicious man-in-the-middle\nattackers. This is what we call downgrade attacks. Fortunately, we\nhave mitigations against these which need to be implemented on both side\nof the protocol.\nOn the client-side of things, a fake tls_fallback_scsv\ncipher suite can be sent after doing a fallback to signal to the server\nwhat happened. The server can then check if both endpoints indeed\nsupport a more recent version of TLS than is being negotiated.\nOn the server-side of things, TLS 1.3-enabled servers who support lower\nTLS versions must include a hint that they support TLS 1.3\nin their random value.\nNote that these mitigations are \"best-effort\", if the other side does\nnot implement them they will be ignored.\nCan I Re-use A Server's Private Key?\nHas research has shown\n[Key Reuse: Theory and Practice,\nDROWN]. Key re-use accross\napplications and protocols can lead to severe vulnerabilities. For this\nreason, it is advised to use a server's private key only for the purpose\nit was designed for.\nHow To Read A Ciphersuite?\nA Cipher suite is just a series of algorithms used in by the TLS\nconnection. As different algorithms can be supported by a server, a\nclient will often advertise a list which the server can choose from.\nThere exist four important algorithms used by TLS that are negotiable:\n\na key exchange algorithm\na cipher for authenticated encryption\na signature algorithm\na hash function\n\nDedepending on the version of TLS in used, each of these might or might\nnot be included in the cipher suite (if they are not, they will be\nincluded in some other field). For example this is a\nTLS 1.3 cipher suite:\nTLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256\n\nWhile this is a TLS 1.2 cipher suite:\nTLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256\n\nWhile this is a TLS 1.1 cipher suite:\nTLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA\n\nAs you can see, these can be pretty cryptic. Note that OpenSSL has\nrenamed all ciphersuites which makes the task of understanding them even\nmore difficult. Fortunately the OWASP has a\ntranslation table.\nWhat Algorithms And Cipher Suites Are Not Secure?\nThere are so many combination of algorithms and ciphersuites available\nthat it is impossible to write up a blacklist. Instead, we will happily\ndo with a whitelist. A perfect combination of algorithms would be a\nbouquet from this list:\nKey Exchange. X448, X25519, ECDHE (with secp256r1, secp384r1 or secp521r1)\nSignature. EdDSA (with Curve448 or Curve25519), ECDSA (with secp256r1, secp384r1 or secp521r1), RSA-PSS with SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512) and RSA-PKCS1 (with SHA-256, SHA-385 or SHA-512).\nAuthenticated Encryption. AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM, Chacha20-Poly1305\nHash. SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-521\nNonetheless, this doesn't mean that other algorithms are not secure.\nHere is a list of other acceptable algorithms:\nRSA key exchange. This key exchange has had a lot of issues with\nthe\nBleichenbacher attack on RSA encryption with PKCS#1 v1.5. Implementations are\nexpected not to leak any information about the correctness of the\ndecryption, but a lot of them still fail this test (the bleichenbacher\nattack has been re-discovered again and again over the years). Hence this mode should be avoided solely\nbecause attacks against it are extremely practical and hard to mitigate\nagainst. In addition, this key exchange does not provide forward secrecy\nand is one of the reason why it has been removed from TLS 1.3.\nDiffie-Hellman (FFDH). Not to mix with ECDH, the Diffie-Hellman\nkey exchange has had its fair share of issues. The\nLOGJAM research found out\nthat the real-world usage of the key exchange had a poor security stance\nwhile it was also found that the protocol was easy to\nbackdoor and that\nsome standards might actually have been. While the protocol can be used\ncorrectly by using known good groups (default in TLS 1.3) or by\ntesting the groups\nsupported by a TLS server, protocols and browsers are moving away from\nit in favor of ECDH and its smaller keys.\nDSA. As for FFDH and ECDH, DSA has seen its key sizes greatly\nreduced by the invention of ECDSA. Which is why pretty much no-one still\nuse DSA. In addition,\nmulti-key attacks are weaker against ECDH as well. This makes DSA not a bad\nalgorithm but a poorly supported one.\nAES-CBC. The infamous cipher has unfortunately been wrongly\nimplemented in SSL/TLS from the start, and has led to several practical\nattacks: POODLE on SSL 3.0, BEAST on TLS 1.0 and Lucky13 on all versions\nof the protocol. That is to say, there exist client-side mitigations for\nBEAST (client-side) and the Lucky13 attack should not be possible if the\nimplementation does not leak information about the correctness of the\ndecryption. That being said, implementations have been found to\nrepeatidly make mistakes there (Lucky13 has been re-discovered many\ntimes) and thus AES-CBC should be quickly deprecated in favor of\nauthenticated ciphers like AES-GCM or Chacha20-Poly1305.\nAES-CCM. Rarely used but sometimes needed, it is plagued by\ninconvenience rather than insecurity. Although there exist an AES-CCM-8\nversion which should be avoided.\n3DES also called DES-CBC3 or DES-EDE (for\nEncryption-Decryption-Encryption) has been targeted by the\nSweet32 research which has helped with its deprecation. Although the attack\nremains highly impractical, which makes 3DES fine (and still actively\nused in the banking world) we have better cipher nowadays.\nTLS can support many more ciphers through various extensions. But it\nwould be too long for us to list why each of them should not be\nincluded. Wikipedia has a\nuseful table that shows what ciphers are deemed secure or not.\nIs Renegotiation A Problem In TLS?\nYes\nand\nno.\nBut this is enough to make us think that renegotiation is bringing more\nissues than it solves and should thus be disabled.\nIs Compression A Problem In TLS?\nTLS Compression and compression at the application both should be\ndisabled because of the\nnumerous compression attacks.\nWhat is DER, .PEM, ASN.1, x.509, BASE64?\nRead this.\nIs 0-RTT (early Data) Secure In TLS 1.3?\nTLS 1.3 introduces a new concept called \"0-RTT\" or \"early data\" which\nallows clients to send encrypted requests to servers during their very\nfirst flight of messages. Because of the design of this feature, these\nmessages are not forward-secure and are replayable. This is a\nproblem if such requests can mutate the state of the server (what we\nsometimes call \"non-idempotent\" requests).\nThis feature has been pushed by big players who want to get faster\nsessions, but their downsides have been\ncriticized heavily which leads us to NOT recommend activating this\nfeature in TLS 1.3.\nIf this feature MUST be used, know that TLS 1.3 clients should maintain\na whitelist of requests that are safe to send as early data and TLS 1.3\nservers should also maintain such a whitelist.\nHow To Assess x.509 Certificates?\nWhile nothing constrain TLS endpoints to use certificates,\nimplementations are generally biased towards its use. Both servers and\nclients can use them to allow the other side of the connection to\nauthenticate them. These certificates contain public keys that will get\nused for the handshake's key exchange. These public keys should be\nsupporting secure key exchange algorithms (see\nWhat Algorithms And Cipher Suites Are Not Secure?) and be of the\ncorrect size. The same should\nbe verified on the entire chain of certificates used by both endpoints\nif a public key infrastructure is in use.\nTo read a certificate in PEM or DER format you can use the OpenSSL\ncommand-line interface:\n\nopenssl x509 -in yourcert.pem -noout -text\n\n\nBut other tools like certstrap exist.\nTo figure out if a certificate is correctly written, check the\ncommon x.509 certificate validation/creation pitfalls and use tools like\nzlint and\nwebPKI.\nTo manually modify a certificate you need to understand the\nDER encoding.\nTo install certificates on your computer easily, there is\nmkcert.\nTo follow the life of certificates, or to check if a certificate was\nmis-issued, crt.sh is useful.\nHow To Test A TLS Server As A Blackbox?\nThere is no easy way to test a TLS server as a blackbox, and it should\nbe avoided if it can. Because of the complexity of TLS implementations,\nyou should always prefer a whitebox assessment.\nThat being said, many tools exist to scan and detect easy problems\n(misconfiguration usually):\n\nsslyze\ntestssl\nTLS-observatory\ncipherscan\nTestSSLServer/\ntlsfuzzer\n\nUnfortunately outputs obtained from these tools are not always clear and\ncan also be false positives. Online scanners also exist:\n\nSSLlabs\nimirhil\n\nThere are stronger tools like TLS Attacker and\nROBOT detect which will look for kwown cryptographic attacks that are\nwrongly mitigated by the TLS implementation.\nThe OpenSSL CLI can be used as a quick-and-dirty client:\n\n$ openssl s_client -connect google.com:443\n\n\nSocat can also be handful:\n\n$ socat stdio openssl-connect:google.com:443,cert=$HOME/etc/client.pem,cafile=$HOME/etc/server.crt\n\n\nHow To Test A TLS Client As A Blackbox?\nTools like TLS Attacker can also be used to test clients against known\ncryptographic attacks.\nTo test TLS clients that are meant to accept any valid certificates, one\nhandy website is badssl.com which is a\ncollection of webservers serving \"bad\" certificates. Your client should\nalways refuse these.\nSome TLS clients are meant to only accept a fixed set of certificates,\nfor example a mobile application connecting to https://api.mywebsite.com\nshould not accept a server broadcasting valid certificate for\nhttps://www.evil.com. To test these you can try to man-the-middle the\nconnection via tools like\nmitmproxy.\nFurthermore, wireshark can be used to analyze if clients correctly split\nAES-CBC payloads to mitigate against the BEAST attack.\n\nDowngrade prevention can be tested as discussed in\nHow To Support Several Versions Of TLS?.\nUnfortunately the list is infinite and it is hard to figure out what to\ntest. As with TLS servers, there are no secrets: TLS clients tests\nshould be code-assisted.\nHow to configure a TLS server correctly?\nTo configure Apache / Nginx / Lighttpd / HAProxy / AWS ELB, Mozilla's\nSSL config generator is the go-to resource. Mozilla also publishes a\nserver-side TLS set of security consideration.\nFor language-specific configurations, refer to:\n\nGo\n...\n\nHow to Analyze a TLS handshake?\nWireshark is the best tool to analyze a TLS handshake. There exist\ngood explanations out there to\nunderstand what is going on.\ncode review of a TLS implementation\nImplementing TLS is very hard, and very few people are capable of doing\nthis securely. See the numerous articles on BearSSL. It would take an entire book to go through the many\npitfalls of implementing such a protocol. It almost always makes more\nsense to use an already existing library like BearSSL or\nBoringSSL.\nBut if you really have to do it, here are some pointers:\nx.509 parsing. Parsing of certificates has been dubbed\nthe most dangerous code in the world, and this is not for nothing. It is\nincredibly hard to parse x.509 certificates correctly. There has been\nmany types of vulnerabilities that have been discovered: denial of\nservices due to unordered certificate chains, null terminators in the\nmiddle of the common name field that allow for domain name spoofing,\nincorrect signatures that still get validated, etc. For this reason, it\nalways makes sense to fuzz them. For this,\nfrankencerts are\nuseful, and pretty much any serious TLS library has corpus available for\nfuzzing them. In addition, note that certificates should be encoded using DER, but not any other encoding (like BER).\nIncorrect state machine. Transitions between different types of\nstate can be tricky, for example you shouldn't accept a\nChangeCipherState message after a Finished message. Their consequences\ncan also be devastating.\nFuzzing can sometimes yield good results.\nPadding errors.\nCryptographic Algorithms.\nwhycheproof\nWhat libraries should I use?\n\nUnfortunately SSL/TLS has suffered from many implementation flaws\nthe most famous one being heartbleed of course\nBearSSL\nBoringSSL (libreSSL?)\nEverest https://project-everest.github.io/\n\nWhat about DTLS?\n\nA final mention about DTLS, which is just TLS over UDP (instead of TCP)\nIt's pretty much the same as TLS, except that some concerns like amplification attacks and IP spoofing have been taken care of by DTLS\nThe idea is that DTLS will perform some sort of TCP handshake before doing any crypto/handshake\n\nWhat about SSH?\n\nThere's not much to say about SSH, besides the fact that you're probably using this in one \nthat is, when you authenticate to a server\nno real indication to give, besides how the keys should be generated and stored.\nDepending on your algorithm, you can refer to the different section of this website\notherwise, check www.keylength.com\n\nWhat about IPSEC?\n\nnope, use wireguard if you can\n\nWhat about VPNs?\n\nwireguard if you can afford to\nhttps://openvpn.fox-it.com/\n\n"},"primitives/asymmetric_encryption.html":{"url":"primitives/asymmetric_encryption.html","title":"Asymmetric Encryption (RSA, ECEIS, signcryption)","keywords":"","body":"Asymmetric Encryption\nRSA\nRSA is both a signature and an asymmetric encryption scheme.
