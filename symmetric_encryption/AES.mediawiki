To encrypt arbitrary-length messages and lengthy communications, symmetric cryptography is often used instead of (or with) asymmetric cryptography. This is because it is fast. Unfortunately many protocols forget that encryption is not enough, as attackers can still tamper with the ciphertexts in order to modify the underlying plaintext. To add integrity, we often use an additional Message Authentication Code (MAC) or better, an all-in-one encryption + integrity primitive.

== Can AES be used alone to encrypt? ==

'''No'''.  Integrity of the ciphertexts must be ensured. For this use an authenticated encryption cipher like AES-GCM.

== What modes of operations are secure for AES? ==

# AES-GCM is the gold standard, as it is often implemented in hardware and is ubiquitously supported by libraries, frameworks and protocols.
# AES-CBC-HMAC is the other infamous construction, which is fine to be used.
# Other mode of operation exist, they will most often be secure as long as the integrity mechanism applies to the IVs and Nonces and the security requirements of the mode of operations are fullfilled (for example, never repeat a nonce)

== What key sizes can I use with AES? ==

AES comes with three types of keys: 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit; while most implementations will only support 128-bit and 256-bit keys. It is accepted that 256-bit keys provide unecessary security, unless you are trying to market your application as having military-grade encryption.

== Can a nonce be repeated in AES-GCM? ==

'''No'''. AES-GCM is not nonce mis-use resistance. If nonces are repeated, the authentication key can be extracted which will destroy the integrity of future ciphertexts. For nonce-misuse resistance check <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-gcmsiv-08">AES-GCM-SIV</a>

== What size should a nonce/IV be in AES-GCM? ==

96-bit

== How many messages can I encrypt with AES-GCM? ==

If the nonce used by AES-GCM is of standard size 96-bit, 2^96 messages can be encrypted. In practice, this means that you can pretty much encrypt an infinity of messages.

== How large a message can I encrypt with AES-GCM? ==

AES-GCM uses a counter to encrypt blocks of 128 bits, the blocksize of AES. If the nonce used by AES-GCM is of standard size 96-bit, a counter is 32-bit wide. This means that at most '''2^32 * 128 bits ~ 68.7GB''' can be encrypted without repeating the nonce.

== Can an IV be predictible in AES-CBC? ==

'''No'''. An IV cannot be repeated nor be predictible, this is what gave rise to attacks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_8-2pDFvmg">the BEAST</a>.

== How many messages can I encrypt with AES-CBC? ==

As no IV should repeat in AES-CBC, it is important to limit the number of messages being encrypted with it. As an IV is 128 bits, sweet32 says that after 2^(128/3) messages it starts becoming dangerous to encrypt more messages. In order to circumvent that change the key at that point.
